HiðŸ‘‹, I am Shivam
I am an undergrad student learning about Information Technology, a developer-in-making you could sayðŸ¤ª. Trying to make my way around this crazy mess, I have made my peace with a few different languages, Python, C and C++, being some of them. One of my favorite friends so far in this adventure is Python; feels "great" with him.

Something about me?
I consider myself a smart worker, and a collaborative team player. Passionately curious is one of the few things I would describe myself as. Believer of forever-learning and the guy who is always happy to help :)

Would love to talk to you about:
